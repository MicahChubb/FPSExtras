This is where I am dumping some extra bits and pieces to help guide extending and changing some things from [The FPS Series]([https://pages.github.com/](https://sites.google.com/ed.act.edu.au/digital-applications/unity/the-fps-series)https://sites.google.com/ed.act.edu.au/digital-applications/unity/the-fps-series). So far I have:
*  Gun Switching

Soon to have:
*  2D adaption of movement script / setup with new input system
